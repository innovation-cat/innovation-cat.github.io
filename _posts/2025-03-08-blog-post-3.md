# Numerical ODE Solver

Numerical methods convert a continuous‚Äêtime initial-value problem into a sequence of discrete algebraic updates that march the solution forward in small time steps.

Numerical ODE solvers work by discretizing the continuous time domain into a sequence of time points: $t_0, t_1, ..., t_{n-1}, t_n$, the interval between any two adjacent time steps is $h$, i,e,. $t_i=t_{i-1}+h$. Given an initial-value problem:

$$
\frac{dx}{dt}=f(t,x),\ \ \ \ x(t_0)=x_0
$$

the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus rewrites the update over one step $h$:

$$
x_{t_{i+1}}=x_{t_i}+h \int_{t_i}^{t_{i+1}}f(t,x)dt
$$

Because the exact integrand $f(t,x)$ is unknown (it involves the unknown path $x$), numerical schemes replace that integral with a tractable quadrature formula  built from sample slopes. The essential difference between different numerical methods lies in the different strategies they use to approximate this integral. 

## One-step vs Multi-step 

This research dimension answers the question: **"How much historical information is needed to computer $x_{t_{n+1}}$?"**

### 1. One-step Methods

A one-step method uses only the information from the single previous point $(t_n, x_{t_n})$ to compute $x_{t_{n+1}}$, it does not care about earlier points like $x_{t_{n-1}}$, $x_{t_{n-2}}$, etc. That is to say, The information for $x_{t_{n+1}}$ is determined entirely by $x_{t_n}$ and some estimates of the slope within the interval $[t_n, t_{n+1}]$, we formalize as general form $x_{t_{n+1}}=x_{t_n}+h*\Phi(t_n, x_{t_n}, h)$   

Some classic numerical one-step methods are listed as follows:

|    Methods     | Order   |  NFE | Sampling Points| Update (explicit form) |
| :--------:  | :-----:  | :----:  | :--------:  | :-----:  | :----:  |
| Euler | 1 |1| $t_n $ | $$x_{t_{n+1}} = x_{t_n} + h*f(t_n, x_{t_n})$$ |
|  Heun (RK2)  | 2 |2| $$t_n \\ t_n+h$$ |  $$k_1=f(t_n, x_{t_n}) \\ k_2=f(t_n+{h}, x_{t_n}+{h}*k_1)  \\  x_{t_{n+1}}=x_{t_n}+\frac{h}{2}*(k_1+k_2)$$ |
| RK3 | 3 |3 | $$t_n \\ t_n+\frac{h}{2} \\ t_n+h$$ | $$k_1=f(t_n, x_{t_n}) \\ k_2=f(t_n+\frac{h}{2}, x_{t_n}+\frac{h}{2}k_1) \\  k_3=f(t_n+h, x_{t_n}-hk_1+2hk_2)  \\  x_{t_{n+1}}=x_{t_n}+\frac{h}{6}(k_1+4k_2+k_3)$$ |
| RK4|4 |4|  $$t_n \\ (t_n+\frac{h}{2})(2\times) \\ t_n+h$$ | $$k_1=f(t_n, x_{t_n}) \\ k_2=f(t_n+\frac{h}{2}, x_{t_n}+\frac{h}{2}k_1) \\ k_3=f(t_n+\frac{h}{2}, x_{t_n}+\frac{h}{2}k_2) \\  k_4=f(t_n+h, x_{t_n}+hk_3)  \\  x_{t_{n+1}}=x_{t_n}+\frac{h}{6}(k_1+2k_2+2k_3+k_4)$$ |

Geometrically, The integral on the right equals the signed area enclosed by the curve $f(t,x)$, the 
$t$-axis, and the vertical lines $t=t_i$ and $t=t_{i+1}$. Higher order numerical methods guarantee a better asymptotic error bound when all other factors (step size, stability, constants, arithmetic) are favourable.

However, in real problems those factors often dominate, so a lower-order method can outperform a higher-order one.

### 2. Multi-step Methods

A multi-step method uses not only the information from the single previous point $(t_n, x_{t_n})$, but also from previous points, such as $(t_{n-1}, x_{t_{n-1}}), (t_{n-2}, x_{t_{n-2}})$, etc.

## Implicit vs Explicit

This research dimension aims to answer the question: "Is the formula for $x_{t_{n+1}}$ is a direct calculation or an equation to be solved?", that is to say, whether $x_{t_{n+1}}$ appears on both sides of the equation simultaneously.
