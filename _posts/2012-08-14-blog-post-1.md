Diffusion models have been shown to be a highly promising approach in the field of image generation. They treat image generation as two independent processes: the forward process, which transforms a complex data distribution into a known prior distribution (typically a standard normal distribution) by gradually injecting noise; and the reverse process, which transforms the prior distribution back into the complex data distribution by gradually removing the noise.

## The unified forward process --- from a discrete perspective

In most cases, the forward process, also known as noise schedules, does not contain any learnable parameters, you only need to "manually" define it in advance. We assume that the data distribution is $p_{data}$, while the prior distribution is $p_{init}$. For any time step $t$, the noised image $x_t$ can be obtained by adding noise $\varepsilon$ ( $\varepsilon \sim p_{init}$)   to a real image $x_0$ ( $x_0 \sim p_{data}$). We can formalize it as the following formula:

$$
x_t=s(t)*x_0+\sigma(t)*\varepsilon\label{eq:discrete-forward}
$$

Where $s(t)$ represents the signal coefficient, and $\sigma(t)$ represents the noise coefficient. The two mainstream types of noise schedules are **Variance Preserving (VP)** and **Variance Exploding (VE)**.

**VP：** At any time step $t$,  The forward (noising) process gradually decays the original signal while injecting matching noise so that the total variance stays constant (usually 1), which means that: $Var(x_t)=s(t)^2+\sigma(t)^2=1$. We can rewrite the VP-type noise scheduling with DDPM format: 

$$
x_t=\sqrt {\bar {\alpha_t}}*x_0+ \sqrt {1-\bar {\alpha_t}} *\varepsilon
$$

Where $s(t) = \sqrt {\bar {\alpha_t}}$ , $\sigma(t) =  \sqrt {1-\bar {\alpha_t}} $. Two commonly used VP-type noise scheduling include linear scheduling (DDPM[^ddpm] and DDIM[^ddim]) and cosine scheduling (iDDPM[^iddpm])

**VE：** The forward process preserves the original signal intact and continuously adds noise, and eventually variance grows unbounded over time. We can rewrite the VE-type noise scheduling with NCSN [^ncsn] format: 

$$
x_t= x_0+ \sigma(t) *\varepsilon
$$

## From discrete perspective to continuous perspective

Diffusion models originally operate in discrete time, with a fixed number of timesteps $t=1,2,\dots,T$, as $T \to \infty$, time becomes a continuous variable $t \in [0,1]$. From this point of view, song et al [^sde] present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) to unify the existing discrete diffusion models. 

Briefly speaking, the discrete noise schedule defined in formula $\ref{eq:discrete-forward}$
