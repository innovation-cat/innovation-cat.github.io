title: 'From Diffusion to Flow — Seeking the Elegant Path'
date: 2025-06-08
excerpt: "In this post, we uncovered the foundations of Flow Matching: the limitations of diffusion models, the constraints of continuous flows, and the transformative idea of directly learning the path between distributions. From the intuition of Rectified Flow to the unifying lens of Stochastic Interpolants, Flow Matching emerged as more than a method — it is a paradigm that reframes generation as learning currents of transformation. With this conceptual map in hand, we are now ready to move from theory to practice."

This series, **the Flow Matching Trilogy**, is a journey through the past, present, and future of generative modeling. 

- [Part 1](https://innovation-cat.github.io/posts/2025/07/flow-matching-1/) introduces the theoretical foundations of Flow Matching, tracing its emergence from diffusion processes and normalizing flows toward a unified framework. 

- [Part 2](https://innovation-cat.github.io/posts/2025/07/flow-matching-2/) turns theory into practice, offering a systematic engineering guide on how to design, control, and accelerate Flow Matching systems. 

- [Part 3](https://innovation-cat.github.io/posts/2025/07/flow-matching-3/) looks outward, exploring the frontiers of research — from discrete and structured data to large-scale and multimodal models.

In the first article, we establishes the foundations of Flow Matching. It reviews the bottlenecks of diffusion models, the constraints of normalizing flows, and introduces the key idea of directly learning transformation paths between distributions. From Rectified Flow to Conditional Flow Matching and Stochastic Interpolants, it outlines how a simple intuition matured into a unified generative framework, paving the way for the practical design discussions in Part 2.
