title: 'The Expanding Landscape of Generative Flows'
date: 2025-08-10
excerpt: "In this post, We examined its extension to discrete and structured domains, its scaling to latent and multimodal spaces, and its dialogue with open challenges in evaluation, alignment, and theory. Flow Matching thus appears not as a closed chapter, but as a living framework whose boundaries continue to expand with research and application. The trilogy concludes here, but the exploration of generative flows has only just begun."

In this final part of the trilogy, we explore how Flow Matching expands beyond continuous pixels to discrete and structured data, scales to large and multimodal systems, and intersects with open challenges in evaluation, alignment, and safety. Here, the story shifts from what Flow Matching is or does to what it can become â€” a foundation for the next generation of generative AI.
