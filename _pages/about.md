Tradition AI approaches are rely heavily on the availability of large-scale and high-quality data but do not provide a mechanism for securely obtaining and using these data. This motivate us to seek for a new training paradigm, which enables multiple devices collaboratively to train a shared model without compromising data privacy and security. More research results can be found in <a href="https://innovation-cat.github.io/publications/">Publications</a>.</p>

We tried to leverage different AI approaches to analyze our customers' listening history and predict their favorite songs, including but not limited to natural language processing, music information retrieval, deep neural network. This work is challenging and requires us to build statistical models for human emotions and interests.</p>
