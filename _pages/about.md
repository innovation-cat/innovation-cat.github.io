A lifelong learner and practitioner, with a strong passion and interest in scientific research and product, achieving business impact by combining effective leadership with deep technical knowledge and skills, continuing to expand the boundaries of knowledge and innovation.

Tradition AI approaches are rely heavily on the availability of large-scale and high-quality data but do not provide a mechanism for securely obtaining and using these data. This motivate us to seek for a new training paradigm, which enables multiple devices collaboratively to train a shared model without compromising data privacy and security.

We tried to leverage different AI approaches to analyze our customers' listening history and predict their favorite songs, including but not limited to natural language processing, music information retrieval, deep neural network. This work is challenging and requires us to build statistical models for human emotions and interests.</p>
